> The project I've built for the HTML &amp; CSS Capstone Project is based on an online website for a conference

This project is the capstone project of in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse. Main goal was to build an online website for a conference. I chose an HTML/CSS bootcamp.

I've worked on all the requirements given on this project.

- Used the clients' colours, layouts and design guidelines.
- Aligned some elements with float and flex or grid.
- Used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content and the footer.
- Styled the elements to look like the design.
- Used Bootstrap.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flex and media queries)
